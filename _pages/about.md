Welcome to my site! My name is Xiaojie Li, and I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Marketing at Simon Business School, University of Rochester.

Prior to Simon, I obtained an MSc in Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a B.S. in Mathematics and B.A. in Economics from Boston College.
