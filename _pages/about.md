Welcome to my website! My name is Xiaojie Li, and I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Carroll School of Management, Boston College. My research focuses on platform economy, including both digital platforms and traditional offline platforms, and influencer marketing.

<!-- advised by Professors [Paul B. Ellickson](http://paulellickson.com/) and [Yufeng Huang](https://sites.google.com/site/yufenghuangphd). -->

I hold a Ph.D. in Marketing from Simon Business School, University of Rochester, an MSc (*with distinction*) in Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics (Honors) from Boston College.
