Welcome to my website! My name is Xiaojie Li, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Marketing at Simon Business School, University of Rochester. I am interested in platform economy, including both digital platforms and traditional offline platforms.

<!-- advised by Professors [Paul B. Ellickson](http://paulellickson.com/) and [Yufeng Huang](https://sites.google.com/site/yufenghuangphd). -->

Prior to Simon, I obtained an MSc (*with distinction*) in Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics (Honors) from Boston College.

I will join the Carroll School of Management at Boston College as an Assistant Professor of Marketing in Summer 2025.
