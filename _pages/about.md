Welcome to my site! My name is Xiaojie Li, and I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Quantitative Marketing at Simon Business School, University of Rochester, advised by Professors [Paul B. Ellickson](http://paulellickson.com/) and [Yufeng Huang](https://sites.google.com/site/yufenghuangphd).

Prior to Simon, I obtained an MSc (*with distinction*) in Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics (Honors) from Boston College.
